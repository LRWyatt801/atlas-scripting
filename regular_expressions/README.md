# Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions (regex or regexp for short) is a text string to describe a search pattern. It is similar to a wildcard (*) as in it is used to search for a pattern, however a regex is more complicated in that it can do much more.  In each task there will be a specific pattern to be searched for using a Ruby script.  The script will accept one argument and pass it to a regex.
